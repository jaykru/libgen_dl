* TODO use zed for search input
* TODO fix unicode title bug, other issues with titles
* TODO fix parallel download bugs, i have no clue what's going on there:
  i think the essential problem here is that we're just hitting
  library.lol too hard when trying to get the cloudflare download
  links. need to figure out some way to throttle the the introduction
  of new pending download promises. Lwt_throttle might be useful but
  potentially deprecated?
  
  should separate the act of grabbing the download link from
  library.lol from the actual download from cloudflare. that way we
  can throttle download-link acquisition but bang on cloudflare super
  hard.
** TODO separate link-getting and downloading
** TODO throttle link-getting
   have a mutex L controlling link-getting ability
   each download promise will operate as follows:
*** begin
*** acquire L
*** sleep 1/2s
*** download link 
*** close L
*** end
** TODO keep downloading as-is
* TODO scale elision of title to terminal width
* TODO add filtering functionality
* DONE when no results are selected for download, we should download the result at the point
* DONE result under cursor shall be highlighted and its information fields colored.
* DONE results selected for download shall be distinguished by a green asterisk to their left
* DONE eliminate uses of require, move to better error handling
* add a non-interactive search mode
  should produces a well-structured textual representation of each
  result and its associated metadata (links, etc) for piping into helper programs
