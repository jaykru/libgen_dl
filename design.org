* TODO when no results are selected for download, we should download the result at the point
* TODO fix unicode title bug, other issues with titles
* TODO fix parallel download bugs, i have no clue what's going on there:
  i think the essential problem here is that we're just hitting
  library.lol too hard when trying to get the cloudflare download
  links. need to figure out some way to throttle the the introduction
  of new pending download promises. Lwt_throttle might be useful but
  potentially deprecated?
  
  should separate the act of grabbing the download link from
  library.lol from the actual download from cloudflare. that way we
  can throttle download-link acquisition but bang on cloudflare super
  hard.
